# CRC_n_HAMMING_CODE

AIM: Simulation of error detection & correction code (CRC, Hamming code) 

## ALGORITHM: 

CRC: 

    1. Open the editor and type the program for error detection 
    2. Get the input in the form of bits. 
    3. Append the redundancy bits. 
    4. Divide the appended data using a divisor polynomial. 
    5. The resulting data should be transmitted to the receiver. 
    6. At the receiver the received data is entered. 
    7. The same process is repeated at the receiver. 
    8. If the remainder is zero there is no error otherwise there is some error in the received bits 
    9. Run the program. 

Hamming Code: 

    Step 1: Start the program. 
    Step 2: Import net and packages. 
    Step 3: Get the 7-bit data code 
    Step 4: Calculation of the number of redundant bits. 
    Step 5: Positioning the redundant bits. 
    Step 6: Calculating the values of each redundant bit. 
    Step 7: Input receiver side data 
    Step 8: Display error and correct data
